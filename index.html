<h1>Welcome To The Unfinshed Website Of Teddy Murphy!</h>

<h2>What can I Expect From This Site?</h2>

<p>As of Now, The 22nd Of April 2025 as I am writing this fateful collection of HTML and javaScript (the latter of which is a pain to deal with) I have no clear objective for this painful corner of the internet and much like life itself, It is entirely usless.</p>

<h2>Where Else Can I Find You?</h2>
<p>I sometimes upload video content to my youtube channel <em>Clicked</em> but this is very rare. I am working on uploading all my works of ambient noise to an unspecifified audio platform but this will take time because I need to find the Hard Drives they are stored on</p>
