<h1>Welcome To Defective By Design!</h1>

<h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>

<p>Here, you can access all my projects, mainly PenTesting tools with some other content mixed in. I also Include Manuals and infomation with these projects. Disclaimer: These Tools are developed entirely for fun and may be ineffective for actual pentesting</p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>Before you use these tools remember that they may not be the most secure. Additionally, Some of these tools in the wrong hands, are capable of causing chaos on networks. I want you to remember that this is illegal and I do not condone these actions. Â¬Clicked 27/04/25</p>
<p>Never use any of these tools on networks you don't own, unless it's a school or over place of education in that case go ahead and have fun but remember to use multiple VPN connections</p>
<p>If any NetRunners want to boot some corpos you can try making a wifi deauther with virtually any microcontroller to send deauth frames to every devices on an access point, preventing people from using it</p>

<h2>SlowLoris DDos</h2>

<p>SlowLoris is a very powerful DDos proggram that can take down some websites with one host. It was designed to overwhelm a single computer, web server or database by opening many simultaneous TCP connections.</p>

<h2>Are You Dead Yet DDos</h2>

<p>R.U.D.Y short for R-U-Dead-Yet is a DDos Tool used to execute slow rate attacks that gradually overwhelm web servers. RUDY implements a type of attack known as a low and slow DDos. the goal is to open a relatively small number of connections to the target and keep them open as long as possible. this consumes all available resources on the server causing it to crash.</p>

<h2>SMB Bruteforce</h2>

<p>An SMB Bruteforce Attack attempts to gain access to an SMB server by attempting every password the attacker specifes in a list called a dictonary. If the password is in the list access will be granted to the SMB server. This particular one, made by me, requires the user to provide their own wordlist.</p>
<p>In trials, this tool proved itself to be very effetive, almost too effective...</p>

<h2>MD5 Hash Decrypter</h2>

<p>When passwords are entered into a website, they are hashed, checked against a database and if the entered password and database match, the user is granted access to the account. The hashing process is put in place so if the password is intercepted on the way to the server (often in a man in the middle attack) they are unreadable. However, when a company experiences a data leak, thousands of hashed passwords are exposed. this shouldnt be a problem as they are supposedly unreadable but with basic python scripts they can be decrypted, giving the attacker the password.</p>

<h1>Important Update!</h1>
<p>This website may have to be deleted in the near future, (because too many people know who I am now) if this occurs I will move to a new site which will be specified on my github.</p>
<p>Right now, this site is a massive security risk and is very possibly being monitored. due to more and more people discovering the person behind 31337_haxx0r I will now use the name 3nr4g3_cru54d3r</p>
