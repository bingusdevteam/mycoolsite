<h1>Welcome To Defective By Design!</h1>

<h2>What Can I Do Here?</h2>

<p>Here, you can access all my projects, mainly PenTesting tools with some other content mixed in. I also Include Manuals and infomation with these projects. Disclaimer: These Tools are developed entirely for fun and may be ineffective for actual pentesting</p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>

<p>Before you use these tools remember that they may not be the most secure. Additionally, Some of these tools in the wrong hands, are capable of causing chaos on networks. I want you to remember that this is illegal and I do not condone these actions. Â¬Clicked 27/04/25</p>
